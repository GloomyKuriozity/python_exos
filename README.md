# python_exos
Multiple exos of python programming

Exo 1 : reverse_linked_list
Reverses a linked list and returns the head of the list.

Exo 2 : two_sum
A Python function called two_sum that takes in a list of integers and an integer target. The function should find and return the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target.

Exo 3 : is_valid_parentheses
A Python function called is_valid_parentheses that takes in a string containing only the characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', and '}'. The function should determine if the input string has valid parentheses, brackets, and curly braces. A string is considered valid if all parentheses are closed in the correct order.

Exo 4 : longest_substring
A Python function called longest_substring that takes in a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. In other words, find the length of the longest substring where each character appears only once.

Exo 5 : merge_intervals
A Python function called merge_intervals that takes in a list of intervals and merges overlapping intervals. An interval is represented as a pair of integers [start, end], where start is the starting point of the interval, and end is the ending point. If intervals overlap, they should be merged into a single interval.

Exo 6 : is_permutation_palindrome
A Python function called is_palindrome_permutation that takes in a string and determines whether it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. A permutation is a rearrangement of characters.

Exo 7 : find_common_elements
A Python function called find_common_elements that takes in two lists and returns a new list containing the common elements between the two input lists. A common element is an element that appears in both lists.

Exo 8 : check_anagrams

Exo 9 : reverse_string
A Python function called reverse_string that takes in a string and returns its reverse. The reverse of a string is obtained by reversing the order of its characters.

Exo 10 : matrix_transposition
A Python function called transpose_matrix that takes in a 2-dimensional list (matrix) and returns its transpose. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of the original matrix.

Exo 11 : counting_elements
A Python function called reverse_words that takes in a string sentence as a parameter and returns a new string where the words are reversed in order.

The words in the string are separated by a single space. You should not reverse the individual characters within each word, only the order of the words.

Here's an example of the expected input and output:

Input: "Hello World" Output: "World Hello"

Input: "I am a programmer" Output: "programmer a am I"

Exo 12 : reverse_words
A Python function called reverse_words that takes in a string sentence as a parameter and returns a new string where the words are reversed in order.

The words in the string are separated by a single space. You should not reverse the individual characters within each word, only the order of the words.

Here's an example of the expected input and output:

Input: "Hello World" Output: "World Hello"

Input: "I am a programmer" Output: "programmer a am I"

Exo 13 : fibonacci_sequence
A Python function called fibonacci that takes in an integer n as a parameter and returns a list of the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1.

Here's an example of the expected input and output:

Input: 8 Output: [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13]

Exo 14 : checker_prime_numbers
A Python program takes in an integer num as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether num is a prime number or not.

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Here's an example of the expected input and output:

Input: 7 Output: True

Input: 12 Output: False

Exo 15 : palindrome_checker
A Python function called is_palindrome that takes in a string text as a parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether text is a palindrome or not.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Here's an example of the expected input and output:

Input: "radar" Output: True

Exo 16 : fizzbuzz_sequence
A Python function called fizzbuzz that takes in an integer n as a parameter and prints the numbers from 1 to n, following these rules:

For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number. For numbers that do not meet any of the above conditions, simply print the number itself. Here's an example of the expected input and output:

Input: 15 Output: 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz

Exo 17 : sum_of_multiples
A Python function called sum_of_multiples that takes in two positive integers, n and limit, and returns the sum of all the multiples of n that are less than or equal to limit.

Input: "Hello World" Output: False
